    <p>Hello there! My name is Chiril Demenev. I'm a sound producer and graphic designer originally from Moscow. In my
      life I've understood one important thing: there are lots of different ways of how we can create something, but
      there's only one way of how we can create this something properly. The only reason why you opened this page is
      very simple: people communicate with each other, and that's how their life comes. At least, if you're already
      here, feel free to contact me and ask any question that you'd like.</p>
